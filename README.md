Applied XGBoost on features(technical indicators columns) + owned features+ signal(own house)
Backtested on different lots size(first backtesting framework :- doing dynamic lots size trade based on capital fraction & premium value)
Also tested on different lot size to check performance for risk assesment scenario:-( 750,75,50) 
Mainly done feature engineering on technical indicators like ml and technical voting giving weights . 
Getting around 80 percent accuracy on composite signals on validating frame and test date .
Mainly on different lot sizs(dynamic) getting around  2500 percent return.
While fixed lot size and using 1 lot size :- making 80,60,and 30 percent capital on different lot size while backtesting showing how much capital we deployed per trade to access returns.
